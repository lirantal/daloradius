	languages, also congrads for joining the development team :)	
	- introduced new menu item - Config - where you can tweak the configuration of daloradius
	from the web gui instead of manually editing the file (notice that the filename and

	values when called from other pages.

	a more comfortable and professional look.
	- added to reports page per username another table to display the
	attributes for a certain user on both radcheck and radreply tables

	show the statistics for the year graph cause of a missing , (comma)
	- fixed in all the upload/download graphs the statistics to show the
