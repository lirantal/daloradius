FAQs
====

	General
	=======

	1. After I login with the administrator account I receive an error page
	   "Fatal error: Call to undefined function: mysql_connect()"

	   This is because the mysql.so extension isn't loaded in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
	   To fix it, edit that file and comment out the mysql.so and possibly the gd.so modules
	   then restart apache2.


	2. In List Users page I don't see all of my users even though I have at least 1.

	   Check if the usernames in RADCHECK and in USERINFO table are the same for the same user.
	   If this is not the case then this will cause the users to not display in the List Users page. 
	   
	   
   
	Config-Maintenance
	==================
	
	1. When I test for user connectivity, after filling all the information in the table fields
	   and pressing the Apply button the page seems to be loading forever and never stops to show
	   results. Why is that?
	   
	   Check your radius server to be up and running and properly configured to reply to the
	   radtest program because otherwise, radtest will continue to send Access-Request packets
	   until the radius server replies back, which in this case will send packets forever.
